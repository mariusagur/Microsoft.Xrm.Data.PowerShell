# Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell

### Overview 
**Microsoft.Xrm.Data.Powershell.zip** contains one primary module, Microsoft.Xrm.Data.Powershell, but also relies on other included dll's such as Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.CrmConnector.Powershell which we are loading as a secondary module (instead of a snap-in). 

New releases of this can be  found on the [Release Page](https://github.com/seanmcne/Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell/releases) or can be downloaded using OneGet (Install-Module) from the Powershell Gallery. 

**Microsoft.Xrm.Data.Powershell** 

This module builds from Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.CrmConnector.Powershell, on top of this we are providing common functions to create, delete, query, and update data.  We have also included many helpful functions for common tasks such as publishing, and manipulating System & CRM User Settings, etc. The module will function for both Dynamics CRM Online and On-Premise environments. Note: while you can import or create data this utility was not specifically designed to do high throughput data imports. For data import please refer to our blog at https://aka.ms/CRMInTheField - you may also review sample code written to add high speed/high throughput data manipulation to .NET projects posted by Austin Jones & Sean McNellis at: https://pfexrmcore.codeplex.com/ 

**Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.CrmConnector.Powershell**

This module comes from Dynamics CRM SDK and it exposes two functions, Get-CrmOrganizations and Get-CrmConnection. See the link for more detail.

### How Microsoft.Xrm.Data.Powershell  works
Microsoft.Xrm.Data.Powershell module exposes many functions, but you can use Connect-CrmOnlineDiscovery, Connect-CrmOnPremDiscovery to connect to any CRM organization by using Discovery Service. Use Connect-CrmOnline function for Azure Automation. By executing these function, it creates $conn global variable. Any other functions which needs to connect to the CRM Organization takes connection parameter. You can explicitly specify the connection by using -conn parameter, but if you omit the connection, functions retrieve connection from global variable.

Alternatively, you can create multiple connection objects and pass them into each function under the –conn parameter.

### Example
This example shows how to create connection and do CRUD operation as well as manipulate System Settings.
1. Run following command to connect to Dynamics CRM Organization via  the Xrm Tooling GUI.
```PowerShell
# Online
Connect-CrmOnlineDiscovery -InteractiveMode
# OnPrem
Connect-CrmOnPremDiscovery -InteractiveMode
# Azure Automation
Connect-CrmOnline -Credential $cred -ServerUri "https://<org>.crm.dynamics.com"
```

For Azure Automation, write all scripts inside inlinescript block as Runbook or use PowerShell type.

2. Run following command to test CRUD.
```PowerShell
# Create an account and store record Guid to a variable 
$accountId = New-CrmRecord -conn $conn -EntityLogicalName account -Fields @{"name"="Sample Account";"telephone1"="555-5555"} 
 
# Display the Guid 
$accountid 
 
# Retrieve a record and store record to a variable 
$account = Get-CrmRecord -conn $conn -EntityLogicalName account -Id $accountId -Fields name,telephone1 
 
# Display the record 
$account 
 
# Set new name value for the record 
$account.name = "Sample Account Updated" 
 
# Update the record 
Set-CrmRecord -conn $conn -CrmRecord $account 
 
# Retrieve the record again and display the result 
Get-CrmRecord -conn $conn -EntityLogicalName account -Id $accountId -Fields name 
 
# Delete the record 
Remove-CrmRecord -conn $conn -CrmRecord $account
```
3. Run following command to manipulate SystemSettings.
```PowerShell
# Display the current setting 
Get-CrmSystemSettings -conn $conn -ShowDisplayName 
 
# Change the PricingDecimalPrecision system setting from 0 to 1 
Set-CrmSystemSettings -conn $conn -PricingDecimalPrecision 1 
 
# Display the current setting 
Get-CrmSystemSettings -conn $conn -ShowDisplayName
```
### How to get command details
